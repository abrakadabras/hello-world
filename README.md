hello world tutorial

Hey ya'll.

I'm a 30 year old hairdresser born and raised in Asheville, NC.
I've always wanted to learn to code. I enjoyed working with html
and css when I was a teenager. I liked to make layouts for my online
jounal. Now I am trying to learn more. I've started some online
coding boot camps and am learning javascript.
